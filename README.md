# 44th BWInf - Round 1 (Luna / 0yqc)

The BWInf is short for Bundeswettbewerb Informatik, a German country-wide informatics competition, where each participant can complete any amount of problems from a pool of ca. 7 problems. The best students will then continue in the next round. For a more detailed explanation, I recommend visiting the official site or the Wikipedia article. Both are on German, but a translator probably will work ok-ish.

# Installation

No further dependencies are needed, just run the Python files. As I use Linux, I can't provide executables for Windows and have decided against making them for Linux due to not many people using linux and Python being easily run.

# Problems

The problems are stated in German in `./Aufgaben441.pdf` and the problems Junioraufgabe 1 & 2 (`./j1/` and `./j2/` respectively) as well as Aufgabe 1 & 2 (`./1/` and `./2/`) were done by me.

There are example inputs located at `./inp/` for every problem and the outputs will most often be in the build log (via print()-statements) or in the case of problem 1 in `./output.svg`
